To send messages using the API, you will first need an API key. You can easily get your key by messaging the bot:

Once you have your API key, you can send messages to Telegram using the following example code:

```python
import requests
from loguru import logger

def alarm_message(message: str) -> None:
    alarm = 'https://t69.me'
    key = "xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx"  # Replace this with your actual API key

    try:
        response = requests.post(alarm, json={'key': key, 'message': message})

        # Optional: Log the response if needed
        if response.status_code != 200:
            logger.error(f"Alarm request failed with status {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
        else:
            logger.info("Alarm sent successfully")
    except Exception as ex:
        logger.error(f'Alarm error for {key}: {str(type(ex))}')
